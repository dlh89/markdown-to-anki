# Markdown to Anki

Convert markdown (.md) files into Anki decks. 

## Does this work with any markdown file?

This application was developed to convert the markdown files in questions-source into decks of Anki questions and answers. In those files, questions are all preceded by `###` (i.e. an `h3` tag) with the answers being the text that immediately follows up until we find the next `###` or the end of the file. Provided the input markdown file works in the same way, this should be generalisable to any markdown file.

## What's Anki?

"Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn."
